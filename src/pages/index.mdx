# Hi, I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹

I have spent the last few years at [Facebook](./about#data-ui-engineer-facebook) and recent startups building a variety of internal data visualization tools and UIs, and have learned a lot since my humble beginnings as a [business analyst](./about#business-intelligence-analyst-nrg-energy) learning and [hacking JS visualizations][gists] with no prior coding background.

All this is possible because of open-source tools and open access to knowledge.  Recently, I have been [actively working](https://github.com/chrisrzhou) on a number of open source projects, simplifying the way we work with data, visualizations, content, and knowledge.

<Flex justifyContent="space-between" my={4} sx={{ height: 400}}>
  <Card sx={{ flex: '0 0 50%' }}>
    <a href="https://react-globe.netlify.app/"><strong>react-globe</strong></a>
    <Globe
      markers={markers}
      options={{
        markerTooltipRenderer: marker => `${marker.id} (${marker.value})`,
      }}
    />
  </Card>
  <Card sx={{ flex: '0 0 50%' }}>
    <a href="https://react-wordcloud.netlify.app/"><strong>react-wordcloud</strong></a>
    <Wordcloud words={words} />
  </Card>
</Flex>

I am extremely excited in the content/document/knowledge problem space and have been sinking many hours on recent projects in these areas.  I would love to advance [these projects](./projects) to the next phases *with you* ðŸ‘Š.

<Card my={4}>
  <a href="https://unified-doc.netlify.app/"><strong>unified-doc</strong></a>
  <Flex alignItems="start" space={3}>
    <DocComponent
      options={{
        content: htmlContent,
        filename: 'doc.html',
      }}
    />
    <DocComponent
      options={{
        content: markdownContent,
        filename: 'doc.md',
      }}
    />
    <DocComponent
      options={{
        content: csvContent,
        filename: 'doc.csv',
      }}
    />
  </Flex>
</Card>

I use any tools for the job and have worked with `r`, `py`, `sql` and various parts of the software stack (building REST/Graphql APIs, plumbing data pipelines), but `js` is my *JAM* to rapidly build cheap solutions consumable via UIs.

Did I mention **cheap**?

Yes, I did, and *cheap is good*.  I strongly believe all things become easier to do over time.  The cheaper we can build things to use/compose/refactor/deprecate, the more efficient the world operates in the long run.

In the spirit of minimalism, this website is built cheapy with:
- three Gatsby MDX [pages](https://github.com/chrisrzhou/dev-2020/tree/main/src/pages)
- simple component APIs for demos of projects in [this page](https://github.com/chrisrzhou/dev-2020/blob/main/src/pages/index.mdx)
- a micro [UI system](https://github.com/chrisrzhou/dev-2020/tree/main/src/ui) built with `theme-ui`.
- minimal [dev dependencies](https://github.com/chrisrzhou/dev-2020/blob/main/package.json) for linting, formatting and typing.

Please feel free to check out my [projects](./projects) and learn more [about](./about) me in this micro website!
