A resume of sorts, but mostly a writeup that will be committed as a checkpoint in my journey as a developer.

## tl;dr

### Scope
What data I cannot render, I do not understand.

With my projects, I try to manage or reduce the entropy of the problem space, and not add to it.

### Values
I value **specs/schema-driven** development.  A problem can only be solved if its boundaries can be well described.

I value working with people more than working on problems.  Human problems can only be solved by people working together.

I value learning, and respect the idea that everyone is both the teacher and the student.  From experience, real progress is rapidly achieved when everyone is able to learn and evolve a system together.

### Beliefs
I believe the cost of software development will eventually approach zero.  Therefore, I prioritize building **cheap** interfaces that are easy to understand/use/refactor/compose/deprecate.

I believe that a progressively fair world can only be achieved if tooling, knowledge, sharing, and learning is increasingly made **open**.

## Projects

### Active
- [`unified-doc`][unified-doc]: A unified way to work with all kinds of documents.
- [`tdast`][tdast]: abstract syntax tree spec and utilities for working with tabular data.
- [`react-globe`][react-globe]: `react` + `three` globe component.
- [`react-wordcloud`][react-wordcloud]: `react` + `d3` wordcloud component.

### Planned
- [`surveyless`][surveyless]: JAMStack serverless survey app
- `unidash`: JAMStack visualization app
- `geneticjs`: JAMStack application to setup, run and visualize genetic algorithms.
- `???`: open up scientific knowledge locked behind journals.

### Archived

## Experience

A resume of my job experience, with personal developments external to work highlighted in blockquotes.

### Frontend Engineer, *Evisort*
Feb 2020 - Present

Built UIs relevant for contract management and integration with NLP/ML pipelines.  Bootstrapped and scaled out a design system with progressive documentation.

> Dived deeper into the document/content/knowledge domain area.  Researched and used [`unified`][unified] to ship the [`unified-doc`][unified-doc] open-source project which provides a unified set of document APIs to solve similar problems across document formats.

### Frontend Engineer, *Roam Analytics*
Jun 2019 - Feb 2020

Built innovative and novel UIs that empower human workflows in NLP/ML pipelines (annotations, search, highlight).  Bootstrapped and scaled out a design system with progressive documentation.

> This was the start of my interest in the document/content/knowledge domain area.  At this point, I am fairly fluent with rapid and cheap UI development, design systems, and progressive documentation.

### Data UI Engineer, *Facebook*
May 2015 - Jun 2019

During my time at Facebook, I designed and shipped multiple data UI products.
- **Rabbit**: Tableau-like data exploration, visualization and dashboarding tool built in `react` + `redux`.
- **Survey Insights**: Visualization and insights dashboard capable of analyzing survey results from third-party sources (e.g. Qualtrics).  Built in `react` + `redux` + `graphql`.
- **fbFiddle**: Facebook JS fiddle supporting internal JS modules.
- Various data UIs and visualization components.

> I kept exploring simpler and open approaches of the problems I faced at work.  `react-globe`, `react-wordcloud` were direct formalizations of some work I did at Facebook.  Learned about JAMStack and migrated personal projects onto Netlify/Gatsby!

### Business Intelligence Analyst, *NRG Energy*
Apr 2011 - May 2015

Self-taught `r`, `py`, `sql`, `vba`, `js`, `d3` to automate traditional marketing reports managed in Excel.

> Unknowingly, my interests and work were already JAMstack-focused (despite the term not being official yet).  These pet projects were all statically built when I was just learning `js` and `d3`: https://bl.ocks.org/chrisrzhou

## Education

### B. in Physics & Mathematics, *Rice University*
2006 - 2009
