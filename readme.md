My developer journey leading up to 2020.

## tl;dr

What data I cannot render, I do not understand.

With my projects, I try to manage or reduce the entropy of the problem space, and not add to it.

I value **specs/schema-driven** development.  A problem can only be solved if its boundaries can be well described.

I believe technological progress will eventually lead to "zero-cost" software development.  I focus on building interfaces and solutions that are **cheap** to use/understand/refactor/deprecate.

I believe that a progressively fair world can only be achieved if tooling, knowledge, sharing, and learning is increasingly made **open**.

## Projects

### Active
- [`unified-doc`][unified-doc]: unified document APIs.
- [`tdast`][tdast]: abstract syntax tree spec and utilities for working with tabular data.
- [`react-globe`][react-globe]: react + three globe component.
- [`react-wordcloud`][react-wordcloud]: react + d3 wordcloud component.
- [`google-globe-trends`][google-globe-trends]: JAMstack application to easily render globe visualizations based on Google Trends.

### Planned
- [`surveyless`][surveyless]: JAMStack serverless survey app
- `unidash`: JAMStack visualization app
- `geneticjs`: JAMStack application to setup, run and visualize genetic algorithms.
- `???`: open up scientific knowledge locked behind journals.

## Experience

A resume-like writeup of my experience, with personal notes not relating to professional experience highlighted in blockquotes.

### **Frontend Engineer**, Evisort
Feb 2020 - Present

Built UIs relevant for contract management and integration with NLP/ML pipelines.  Bootstrapped and scaled out a design system with progressive documentation.

> Dived deeper into the document/content/knowledge domain area.  Researched and used [`unified`][unified] to ship the [`unified-doc`][unified-doc] open-source which provides a unified set of document APIs to solve similar problems across document formats.

### **Frontend Engineer**, Roam Analytics
Jun 2019 - Feb 2020

Built innovative and novel UIs that empower human workflows in NLP/ML pipelines (annotations, search, highlight).  Bootstrapped and scaled out a design system with progressive documentation.

> This was the start of my interest in the document/content/knowledge domain area.  At this point, I'm fairly fluent with rapid and cheap UI development, design systems, and progressive documentation.

### **Data UI Engineer**, Facebook
May 2015 - Jun 2019

During my time at Facebook, I designed and shipped multiple data UI products.
- **Rabbit**: Tableau-like data exploration, visualization and dashboarding tool built in `react` + `redux`.
- **Survey Insights**: Visualization and insights dashboard capable of analyzing survey results from third-party sources (e.g. Qualtrics).  Built in `react` + `redux` + `graphql`.
- **fbFiddle**: Facebook JS fiddle supporting internal JS modules.
- Various data UIs and visualization components.

> Always explored simpler and more open approaches of the problems I faced at work.  `react-globe`, `react-wordcloud` were direct formalizations of the work I did at Facebook.  Learned about JAMStack and migrated personal projects onto Netlify/Gatsby!

### **Business Intelligence Analyst**, NRG Energy
Apr 2011 - May 2015

Self-taught `r`, `py`, `sql`, `vba` to automate traditional marketing reports managed in Excel.

> Stumbled on `js`, `d3`.  Unknowingly, my interests and work were already JAMstack-focused (despite the term not being coined yet).
